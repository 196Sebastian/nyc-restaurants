# 🌟 Project Description ![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url?style=social&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F196Sebastian)
- An application allowing users to create a list of some of their favorite restaurants.
- Users can add a description of the restaurant with information like the ambience and the type of food the restaurant serves. 
- Swipe to the right allows you to edit any previous listings and a swipe to the left lets you delete a listing.
- Clicking on a listing brings you up to a new page with the ability to view the description that you've written, view the location 
using Google Map API and the ability to share your favorite restaurants with others!

# 👨‍💻 The Building Process
- Used external dimensions to keep the project maintainable.
- Application uses a calendar picker using DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener() which provides a widget for selecting a date.
- Kept the project clean by creating different directories for our activities, models and databases.
- Before a user can save a restaurant of their choosing information has to be added first which is then saved via SQLite to our local database.
- Used a third party library for our nice rounded images.
- In order to keep the list updating dynamically I added ActivityForResult.
- Sharing your favorite restaurant with friends via email or social networking using the Android sharesheet. 
- The swipe to edit functionality is using itemTouchHelper as well as the delete functionality.
- Application uses Google Places API.
